### Simple Buffers v0.1.2

New filtering options:
- Item limits: limit the transfering of items based on how many matching items are already in an inventory
- Compress stacks mode: as opposed to the default "first-in, first-out" mode, a buffer in this mode will try to take up as little space in its internal inventory as possible.

### Simple Buffers v0.1.1

Minor bugfixes:
- Better compatibility with Forge mods
- Spec sheets stack right
