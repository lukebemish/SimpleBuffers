Minecraft mod that adds highly configurable "buffers" to help ease automation. Buffers work on a First-In-First-Out system - items are "queued" inside so that the earliest items added have the highest priority for leaving the buffer. Buffers can be filtered independently on every side, sped up with upgrades, or be controlled with redstone. Additionally, buffers can be passively pushed or pulled from - using hoppers, or pipes from other mods - and can actively push or pull from inventories as well.
